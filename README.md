# phd-thesis
This repository includes all the scripts developed within the work of my Ph.D. Thesis and included in Appendix D.

The Sections within the Appendix are:
- D.1) Day-ahead and imbalance price forecasting with ARMAX models;
- D.2) Monte Carlo simulations;
- D.3) Benchmark price forecasting model; and
- D.4) Imbalance sign forecasting.

The files are:
- Price_Rec_exp.R: Recursively expanding model to forecast prices.
- Price_Rolling.R: Rolling (moving window) model to forecast prices.

- Monte_Carlo.py: Monte Carlo simulations.

- price_benchmark.py: Benchmark method (variation of "similar-day").

- NIV_RecExp.R: Recursively expanding model to forecast imbalance sign.
